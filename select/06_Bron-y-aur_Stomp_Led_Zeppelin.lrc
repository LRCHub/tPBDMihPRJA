[00:44.24] Ah, I caught you smilin' at me, that's the way it should be
[00:50.80] Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
[00:57.68] Ah, all the good times we had, I sung love songs so glad
[01:03.74] Always smilin', never sad, so fine
[01:20.74] 
[01:11.39] As we walk down the country lanes
[01:13.43] I'll be singin' a song, you hear me callin' your name
[01:19.88] Hear the wind whisper in the trees
[01:22.31] Tellin' Mother Nature 'bout you and me
[01:41.31] 
[01:34.56] Well, if the sun shines so bright, or our way is dark as night
[01:39.55] The road we choose is always right, so fine
[01:46.86] Ah, could any love be so strong when so many loves go wrong
[01:52.82] Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?
[02:20.32] 
[02:00.25] As we walk down the country lanes
[02:02.33] I'm singin' a song, hear me callin' your name
[02:09.12] Hear the wind whisper in the trees
[02:11.44] Tellin' Mother Nature 'bout a-you and me
[02:31.44] 
[02:27.10] My, my, law-de-law, come on, now, it ain't too far
[02:31.10] Tell your friends all around the world
[02:33.61] Ain't no companion like a blue-eyed Merle
[02:54.11] 
[02:45.92] Come on, now, well, let me tell ya
[02:47.63] What you're missin', messin' around them brick walls
[03:13.63] 
[02:51.69] So, of one thing I am sure, it's a friendship so pure
[03:18.19] 
[03:33.08] Angels singin' all 'round my door, so fine
[03:40.57] Yeah, ain't but one thing to do, spend my natural life with you
[03:46.75] You're the finest dog I knew, so fine
[04:05.25] 
[03:54.70] When you're old and your eyes are dim
[03:56.83] There ain't no 'Old Shep' gonna happen again
[04:03.34] We'll still go walkin' down country lanes
[04:06.16] I'll sing the same old song, hear me call your name
