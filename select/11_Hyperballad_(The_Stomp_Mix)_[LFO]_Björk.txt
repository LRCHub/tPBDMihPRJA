We live on a mountain
Right at the top
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain
Every morning i walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like Car parts, bottles and cutlery or whatever i find lying around
It's become a habit
A way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So i can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So i can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early morning
No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make on their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks and when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So i can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So i can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So i can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
